# STM-Micro-Exercises-PLSD-
Collection of exercises carried out during the Logical Design of Digital Systems course at the University of Parma.
The exercises concern simple applications of circuits whose aim is to develop additional functionality step by step.

The main objective is to create an embedded system that is able to connect to the cloud network through a LoRA type connection,
and that is able to perform a specific functionality to support the user.

Only the main scripts are added in this repository.

# Hardware used:
-STM32WL55JC microcontroller multiprotocol LPWAN dual-core 32-bit<br>
-Motion MEMS and environmental sensor expansion board for STM32 Nucleo
